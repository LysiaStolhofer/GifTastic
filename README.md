# GifTastic

This is a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of the world of sports. 
The GIPHY API needs to be called and JS and jQuery is used to change the HTML of the site. 

- 8 (already existing) buttons display some of my favorite sports
- the user is able to add and delete buttons of other sports of his/her choice
- when the user clicks on the button, we call different gifs from GIPHY to be displayed on out site
  which respons to our sport we clicked on
- the already existing buttons can not be deleted/only the ones the user creates himself/herself

try it yourself & enjoy!
